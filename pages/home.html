                    I developed and automated end-to-end regression tests using Java/Selenium, reviewed outcomes via GitHub Actions and Datadog Dashboards. I am adept at writing and executing SQL queries for effective database management. I utilized developer tools to inspect frontend elements, monitor network activity, and tracked errors through Datadog logging. Defect reports were generated in Shortcut and GitHub, while working closely with development, product teams to prioritize and resolve issues. Additionally, I conduct rigorous regression testing across browsers and mobile devices using BrowserStack to ensure the integrity of application functionality.

                <p>I maintained high-value test cases in TestRail and conducted daily manual regression and smoke testing across mobile and desktop platforms. I developed test plans aligned with business requirements and presented feature demos to enhance testing visibility within the QA team. I reported detailed bugs in JIRA, including Charles Proxy logs, and worked with stakeholders and development teams to resolve issues and ensure timely releases. Additionally, I balanced multiple projects across platforms, focusing on UI, functional, and integration testing, while coordinating QA strategies and release timelines with business and development teams.</p>
